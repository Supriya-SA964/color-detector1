# Color Detection Project

This is a **Color Detection Web Application** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- **Live Camera Detection**: Capture live images from your camera and detect colors in real-time.
- **Image Upload Detection**: Upload an image file, and the app detects colors from it.
- **Color Information**: Displays the **color name** and **HEX value** of the detected colors.

## How It Works
1. Open `index.html` in a browser that supports camera access (e.g., Chrome or Firefox).
2. For live detection, allow camera access when prompted.
3. For image upload, click **Choose File** and select an image.
4. The detected color name and HEX value will be displayed on the page.

## Files
- `index.html` → Main webpage for live detection and file upload.
- `script.js` → JavaScript code to detect colors and display their names & HEX codes.
- `README.md` → Project description.



## Future Improvements
- Highlight multiple colors in an image automatically.
- Add **RGB values** along with HEX and color names.
- Improve UI/UX for mobile devices.
